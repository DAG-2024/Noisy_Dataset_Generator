All right. So let's do a couple of examples. So the first exam. So suppose I want to integrate x squared sin x. this would solve, so this would give the solution to dy dx equals x squared sin x. So in the integration by parts, you have to decide which one is f and which one's g. Now, clearly, I would like to decrease the power here. I know I can never get rid of the sign by differentiation. So then maybe this, then I have to do this f,and this is g prime, which means that g is minus cos x.
