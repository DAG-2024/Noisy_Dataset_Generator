And in Python, the meaning to this is, I want to repeat the sequence of characters high,each I five times. So this would basically give me high, high, high, high. So once we have sentences in English, write, and expressions that are syntactically valid,we can now talk about the static semantics of the language. So in English, saying something like,I are hungry is syntactically correct,but it's not good static semantics. There's no meaning to that, because the R is for youor plural. Similarly, in programming languages,and this will differ depending on what programming languageyou use. Here, in the previous slide, we sawthat you can use the star operator between the sequenceof characters in the number. And that meant repeat that sequence many times. But if we use a plus operator in between the sequenceof characters and a number, that doesn't have any meaningin Python. So it has a static semantic error, eventhough it's syntactically valid. We have object operator object.
