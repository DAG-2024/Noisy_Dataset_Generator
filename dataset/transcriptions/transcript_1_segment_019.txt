So if I call this integral i, i is x squared times minuscos x. And then minus the derivative of f, which is 2x times minuscos x dx. This is minus x squared cos x plus 2 times xx dx. And now again, this should be f, and this should be g prime. Now again, this should be f and this should be g prime. Well, x plus 2 times x sine x minus 2 times sine x dx. So please try to follow through what I'm doing. And let me know if I make a mistake. This is my nightmare to do integrals like this while I'mbeing filmed.
