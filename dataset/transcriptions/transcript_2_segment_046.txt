So now x is 2, y is what? What did I do? Yeah. So this happens sometimes. We can just start all over, right? So y equals temp, sorry, sorry, sorry. Temp equals y. y equals x. y is 1, x is 1, and then x equals temp. y is 1, x is 2. So it's okay if things go wrong. They will go wrong. We can just start all over in this particular caseby redefining our variables and just trying it out all over again. So that's kind of what the shell is for. That's what I use it for. That's what we're going to use it for in the future. Just to do quick things like this, and also things like checking the types and othercommands we've done earlier. Okay, so any questions before we do the summary? Was this all right pace or was it too fast? Or it's okay. Okay, good. Thumbs up is good. So let's do a quick summary.
