It has R stands for resistor. So it has a resistor R. It has an inductor L with inductance L. And it has a capacitor with capacitance C. And it has a source of voltage, something like a battery, V. So here's, so I have a capacitor with C capacitance. And the resistor with R resistance and an inductor with L inductance. So here, R, R, L, and C are constants. They're independent of time.
