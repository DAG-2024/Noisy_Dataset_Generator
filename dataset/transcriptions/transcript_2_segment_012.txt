With sentences, we can build up stories. With stories, we can build up books and things like that. In programming languages, the primitives are numbers. Sequences of characters, operators like addition,multiplication, division, checking free quality,checking for equality, checking that something is greater than things like that. So once we have these primitives in a language, we can start to build up the syntax of thelanguage. So in English, having something like noun and noun, doesn't make any sense, right? Cat Dog Boy doesn't make much sense, it's not syntactically valid. But noun verb noun is syntactically valid, right? Similarly, in programming languages, we can have two objects kind of side by side. So here, this is a sequence of characters, H and I, and this is the number five rightbeside that sequence of characters. But that doesn't make any sense. What does it mean to have this sequence of characters in that number right beside? It has no meaning in Python. Instead, what we have to do is we have to add an operator in between these two objects. So here we add a little star operator in between the sequence of characters high and the numberfive.
