And then meters 200 feet remained 328.08. So obviously this is a pretty simple programto run the Python Tutoron. but you can imagine using it in more complex settings. How about one more? And this is my last example. I want you to try to write a program that swaps the valuesof x and y. So originally, and I'll draw this memory diagram real quick. So we have, this is our memory. We have x is bound to 1. y is bound to 2. And what I want to do without saying x equals 2, y equals 1. And what I want to do is swap the values. I want x to be associated with 2 and y to be associated with 1. But only using commands like this. And so the code here is buggy. That means it's wrong. It has an error in it. Because, well, let's step through a little bit at a time. y equals x. What do I do when y equals x here? Yeah, exactly. Why is going to move from two to one? Now, what happens when I do x equals y?
