Yes, x stays the same. My first line, y equals x, lost the binding to two. Right? And now it's almost up, because I can't get it back. So instead, so if you didn't understand this,you can click Python tutor and just kind of step by step on your own. But how can we fix this? Create a third variable? Yeah, that's a great idea. Yeah, we can create a third variable. So x is 1y is 1. y is 2. So we can create a third variable. What do you want to make the variable equal to? x or y? Yeah, either one. I made it y. So let's do y. So here I've got a temporary variable called temp,and I made it equal to 2. And now what can I do? Which one can I reassign now? X equals y or y equals x? Exactly. If I do x equals y, I lose my binding to 1,and I'm messed up again. So y equals x is OK to do. So I'm going to lose the binding from y, from 2,and bind it up to one. And now what do I do?
