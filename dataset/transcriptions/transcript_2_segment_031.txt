So what we can do to get to that endis to start assigning names to some of these objects. If I create an object for pi in my programto 20 decimal places, somehow, and Ihave that number in my program, that float in my program,if I want to use that number in many different placesin my program, I'd have to copy and paste ita whole bunch of times, right, so far. Which is very tedious. Lots of errors will happen. I don't want to do that. So instead, what I can do is I can give a name to thisridiculously long value of pi, called pi, right? And then I can just use this name anywhere I want to grabthat ridiculously long value for pi in my program. It's a lot easier to read, right? It's a lot easier for me to write this program. And it leads to a really nice and neat program. So what we can do is we can start saying that, you know,The float point 001 will be referenced by the name small. Or the 100 point four will be referenced by the name 10. So what we want to do is create these thingscalled variables.
