I find the shell very useful if there'sjust something really quick that I want to check that I don'twant to write a program for and then run. It's just like a simple command that I want to checkto make sure it's doing what I think it's doingbefore I insert it in my code editor. So here we have this. So mine is, I guess I'm using the white theme justbecause I find it easier for you guys to see. This is the file editor. And this is just a bunch of expressions. Yeah, a bunch of code that we're going to type in today. And we're going to type it in the shell today,so the thing on the right-hand side. Okay, so what exactly do we do when we write a program? At the base of it, we are going to create objects inside our programs and we're going tomanipulate them. That's it. That's what programming is mostly about at its core. Now when we create objects, it's important. This is kind of something we're going to come back to again and again in a kind of morehigh level setting. But right now, what I want you to understand is that when we create an object, an objecthas a type.
