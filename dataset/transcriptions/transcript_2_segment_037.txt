So when Python sees my pi and my radius,it grabs them from memory, replaces them with the values,evaluates the expression, grabs that one value,that we evaluated to 15 point something, whatever this is,and binds the 15 point something to the name area. Same with circumference. Code style is something that we're actually gonna look atin your problem sets. So I just wanted to quickly talk about that. Here is a program that has really bad style. Actually, that shouldn't be, it should be terrible or something like that. But in case you haven't noticed, it's the same program as on the previous slide. But if I gave you this program straight off the bat,you probably wouldn't know what it's doing. It's reusing 355 over 113 twice here. It's using just A and C as variable names. This description is due calculations. So pretty bad. This is a little bit better. I've recognized that 3, 5, 5 over 1, 1, 3 is being used twice,so I'm saving it as a variable. But my variables are still single characters. And my comments are pretty bad.
