And now you can integrate just as we did before. So you'll get then the integral, yes. Yes. So the left hand side is the integral dy over b of yand the right hand side is ax dx. And now you have two direct integrations, which hopefullywe can solve, right? The type of integrals that we have in this coursewill be the kind for which you can apply integration by partsor some other techniques and solve them. If I were to write an arbitrary function there and ask youhow to integrate it, then we can't do that in a closed formula. OK, so here's an example. find the general solution to the separable differential equation.
