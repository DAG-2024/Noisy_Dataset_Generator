The eight problem sheets you'll cover in four tutorialsin your college. So four hours, our tutorial. What do I? So I said the lecture notes online. The reading list is also online. So see online. The book that I like is Mary Boe's mathematical methodsin physical sciences, this book. And most of your colleges should have a copy of this, if not, the university does as well. So this book is quite concise and it has various examples from physics and engineeringand so it also has the added advantagethat if unlike the other books on the reading list,if you drop this one on your foot,you might be able to walk without seeing an orthopedic surgeon.
