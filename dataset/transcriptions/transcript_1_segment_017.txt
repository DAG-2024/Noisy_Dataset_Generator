So f times g prime is f prime g plus f g prime, whichmeans that f times g prime equals f times g prime minus f prime times g. And if I integrate both sides, then I end up with the integration by part, which isf times g prime dx, if there are functions of x,equals f times g minus f prime times g dx. So this is the version, the indefinite integral version. You can have a definite integral versionwhere you put the limits of integration. So let me spell it out. So this is the definite integrals version.
