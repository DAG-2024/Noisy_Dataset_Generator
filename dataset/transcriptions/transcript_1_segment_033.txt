So you put your substitute this in there,And I get that i6 is 1 6th cos to the 5th x sine x plus 5over 24 cos cubed x sine x plus 5 times 3 times 1 over 6 times 4times 2 cos x sine x plus 5 times 3 over 1 over 6 times 4 times 2 x times 2 x. So it has, I think you can probably cook up a general formula using this example. You see how it goes. So if I asked you to write a sum involving all the terms, I think you can get the coefficientsof each term inductively.
