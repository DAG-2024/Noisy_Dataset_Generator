like a pocket calculator is an example of that. Every button was an operation. You could, in the little screen,you could use parentheses to put a bunchof different operations together,but there was no way to sort of storeall these operations together to later put in different inputsfor that same sequence of operations. You had to input it every single time. Input those sequences of operations every single time. After the 1940s, stored program's computer,computers came into play and they were able to store instructions to do things as data. And there was a special program called an interpreter that executed these instructions. It knew how to follow simple sequences of steps when the program told it to go toa different location it did. So it was basically executing these instructions. And the instructions that it did were arithmetic and logical, so addition subtraction, thingslike that. Simple tests like checking for equality between two values and moving data, so taking thisvalue and putting it at a different memory location. So I just wanted to give you a really brief overview and this is not super accurate, butit gives you a sense of how exactly things happen low level in the computer.
