Now, the easiest way to write this is to get rid of thelogarithm by moving this to the other side using theproperties of the logarithm and exponentiate. So let's do that. So we have one half. If I move the logarithm in x to the left-hand side,then I use the property. Well, it doesn't matter much, equals c, whichmeans that the equation will be y squared minus 1 times 1minus x squared, absolute value equals, itwould be e2c squared, or e2c, which I can just call anotherkind of c. And this would be a positive number. So the equation that we get is, so the answerthan is that? Where C is positive. But I can relax that this is always positive because1 minus x squared is always positive because I'm assuming x is between 0 and 1.
