Move the tape left. Move the tape right. Read the value at the tape. Put a value on the tape. Erase the value from the tape and no operation. And so since he showed this, what the result of it actuallywas is down here. Anything computable in one languageis computable in any other programming language. So if we had some programmer in Java,that basically boils down to something super long,but something that is made up of these six primitives. That means that if we boil down this programto these six primitives, we can build back upthe same program in a completely different language. And that's really powerful. That's a really cool statement. Now, we're not gonna be working with those primitives. We're gonna be using the Python primitives,which are more convenient,and they allow us to do a lot more things in much less time. I'm gonna do a look comparisonas we talk about the primitives of Python with English. So in English, some of the primitives might be words,or even we can do letters or characters,but we can say it's words. With characters, we can build up words. With words, we can build up sentences.
