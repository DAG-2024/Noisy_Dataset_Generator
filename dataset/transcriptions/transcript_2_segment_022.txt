We're not changing the three. The three already exists. We're just getting the float version of itand storing it as a new object in memory. So when we do float three, this is a command that gets for methe float version of the integer three. So that will give me 3.0. So for example, this is what we're going to do. what I had, float 3. The output is 3.0. If I do int of 5.2, it truncates it,and it gives me the integer portion of this float. If I do int of 5.9, it still truncates itand gives me the integer version of this float. It doesn't round. I'm just asking for the integer version of this float. Some operations like round is an operation we can do. Has an implicit cast in it. So if I round 5.9, it's actually going to round it to 6.0and then cast it to an integer. So notice it doesn't give me as an output 6.0. It then rounds it to just 6. So that's basically what I said in the example.
