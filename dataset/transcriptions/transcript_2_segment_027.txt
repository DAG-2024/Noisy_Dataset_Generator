Mathematical expressions work left to right, just like in math. Parentheses can override certain precedents. If we have commands that have computations,then we have this command with the parentheses and we evaluate what's inside the parenthesis first. So we work our way in to out in that particular case. So here's some examples. Let's have you try these. So we can type these in our console. What are the values of the following expressions? So 13 minus 4 divided by 12 times 12. So we can try that. I don't know off the top of my head. So we'll have to type it in 0.0625. So the value of that expression is a float, 0.0625. What's the value of the expression type 4 times 3? Int. Yup. What about the type of expression 4.0 times 3? Yes. Exactly. That's very good. So type of 4 times 3 is int, but 4.0 times 3 is a float. Good. And then what about int of a half or 1 over 2?
