So the hint is already in the problemthat this is a separable differential equationx times y squared minus 1 plus y x squared minus 1dy dx equals to 0. And x is between 0 and 1 to avoid some issuesabout continuity or what not. How do you separate this differential equation? How do you separate the variables? So I think you're about two steps ahead of me. So I will, but it's correct. But let me do it step by step. So what I will do is first isolate that. So I have y x squared minus 1 dy dx equals minus x y squared minus 1.
