Yeah, exactly. It's zero. Yep. Because it's 0.5 and we truncate to zero. The reason I had this here is because it leads nicely into this slide. You don't have to memorize these rules. You can always check it out in the console. But there are some rules for the resulting types when we do operations. So when we do operations with numbers, addition, subtraction, and multiplication,Always yield an integer if both of the operators are integers. If one is a float or both are floats, then it gives me a float. Division is different, no matter what types you divide, you'll always get a float. Now what about this slash slash and this percent? These are actually useful operations. They kind of go hand in hand with division. So when I do 5 divided by 3, it's this 1.667. Slash slash is basically a floor or getting the integerportion of the division. So 5 slash slash 3 gives me 1. It truncates the fraction.
