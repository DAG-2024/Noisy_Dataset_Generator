So we're just scratching the surface a little bit. All right, now going back to what I said before, the simplest kind of OD is dy dx equalsf of x, which you can solve by direct integration. So let me review a couple of facts about integration. So one of the most useful techniques, which I'm sure most of you are quite familiar with,is integration by parts. Okay, so where does integration by parts come from? Well, it comes from the product rule, product ora live needs rule if you want to sound fancy for derivatives. So if I have two functions, f and g, and I multiply them,and then I differentiate.
