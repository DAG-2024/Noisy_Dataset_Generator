There's differential equations. There's a big option, fluid and waves, et cetera. So this is a very useful course. It's also mandatory. So you have to be here. So now let me give you some examples of where all these might appear. OK, so all these. So what is a ordinary differential equation? So this is an equation involving an independent variable. Let's call it x. And a function of x, which we call it y.
