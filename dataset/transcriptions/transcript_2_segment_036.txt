So when you write programs, it'simportant to choose variable names wisely. You don't want to use just single letters. You don't want to name it something thatdoesn't have something to do with the program you're writing,because you're going to want to reread these programssometime in the future. Or others might want to read your programs sometimein the future. So here's an example of a nice program. It's just basically for assignment statementsthat do some calculations. The first line of the program is not really a line. It's called a comment. You can have as many of these as you'd like,they start with a hash. It's a line that starts with a hash. And it's basically a text that you write that helps youor others figure out what the code is supposed to do. And usually we comment sort of large chunks of codeat a time, not line by line. Then we have these four assignment statements. So here I'm defining variable named pi, bound to the value here,so not the division, but 3.14159. Variable named radius bound to this float 2.2. And then I have a variable named area, which is boundto the result of this expression.
