Declarative knowledge is a statement of factAnd a lot of us, probably in math and in the past,have worked with declarative knowledge. But this is not how computer science is,not how this class works. In computer science, what we do is we work with imperativeknowledge, which is basically a recipe, how to do something. And when we're programming, all we're doingis writing a recipe for the computer to do something. That's it. So here's a numerical example. The first statement is a declarative statement, right? The squared of a number x is y such that y times y is equal to x. There are many possible values for x and ythat this statement can be true, right? But if we gave that statement to a computer,it wouldn't know what to do with it. What we need to do is tell the computer howto find the squared of a number and then tell uswhat the squared of that number is. And so the computer then needs a recipe. So the recipe, a really simple one, for finding the square of a number is steps 1, 2, 3. So what we do is, let's say we want to find the square of 16. We obviously know it's 4, but the computer doesn't. And so we give it an initial guess. Let's say the guess is 3.
