Okay, so this is a quick review of integration by parts. If you're not fully comfortable with these examples or similar examples, then get an integrationtextbook and do a few more examples with integration by parts, substitutions, and so on. Because what we will do in solving differential equations will learn a lot of techniques,but ultimately you will have to integrate some functions. So you should be able to do that. So what we learn is how to reduce the problem to integrating various functions. But you'll have to be able to do that. Okay. So we discussed about the simplest kind of ODEs, whichcan be solved just by direct integration. The next simplest of these are the so-called separable.
