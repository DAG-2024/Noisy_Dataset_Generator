Arc 10 or 10 inverse depending how you want to denote it. We noted this is arc 10 of x, just 10 inverse of x. Now what do we do with this? We can substitute. Yeah, let's do that so that we remember how to do substitutions. You might just look at it and know what it is, right? But just to review substitution, if Iit u equals x squared plus 1, then d u equals 2x, d u d x equals 2x, which means that thisis 1 half d u over u, which is 1 half ln of u, which is 1 half ln of x squared plus 1. you might have guessed just because you have enough practice. Some of you.
