So we had the case dy dx equals f of x, which you can just integrate. The next case would be dy dx equals a of x times b of y. So what I mean by that is that this is a function only in x, only, andB of y is a function of y only. If you have a situation like that, then you can reduce it to the directintegration with one simple trick. If b y is not 0, then you divide by it, and you get 1 over b of y d y d x equals a x.
