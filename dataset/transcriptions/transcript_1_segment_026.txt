Thank you. Any other mistakes? All right. So that's an integral. There are cases when integration by parts will not simplify either of the two functions fng,but what happens is if you do it twice, then you sort of come back to what you started with. So the typical example is i equals the integral e to the x sine x dx. So maybe we don't need to go through the entire calculation. This is in the lecture notes as well.
