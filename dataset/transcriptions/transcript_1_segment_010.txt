is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time. So that's already a differential equation. But it could be a second order differential equationif you think that v is dr dt, where r is the displacement. Then you get, for example, A is the squared, our dt squared, which is a second order differential equation. So that's an easy example of how differential equations appear in mechanics. Well, you could also have differential equations in engineering,or if you have an electrical circuit. So if I take a simple one, so a simple series circuit,which, for example, an RLC circuit, whichmeans that it has the following components.
