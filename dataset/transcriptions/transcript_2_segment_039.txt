I'm going to use this sort of cloud pictureto represent what happens behind the scenes wheneverwe write programs. And it's a good line of motion to help you understandline by line what's going on. So here we have pi equals 3.14. So the green 3.14 is my value in memory. Cloud is memory. That's my value in memory, and it's bound to this name pi. So this is my variable name. The next line, radius equals 2.2, same thing. I've got 2.2 as my value in memory, my object,and radius is the name for that object. Area equals pi times radius squared. So what happens behind the scenes is it calculates this value. It doesn't store the expression. It stores the value resulting from the calculation. And then it saves it, it binds it to the name area. Everything OK so far? We've seen this code before. So now what happens when we do this radius equals radius plus 1? In math, that would say 0 equals 1. But we're not in math here, right? We're in computer science. And this is perfectly valid. We're following the rule, right? when we have an assignment that says,look at the right hand side first and evaluate it.
