Right? So this is my first big idea slide. I decided to insert these because I think they kind of stressthe importance of several concepts. So I hope this is one. So we're taking expressions. They can be as complex as you'd like. We can use parentheses. You know, a bunch of, it doesn't just have to be object,operator object, it can be more complex than that. But basically, however complex that expression is,we evaluate it and we replace it with one value. And the expression can be something like this. It doesn't just have to be something that's mathematical,right? This was a mathematical expression, but this is also an expression. And it evaluates. So this entire thing evaluates to this,where this word represents the type integer. So here are some more examples, 3 plus 2. Again, we've got these examples with the parentheses,4 plus 2 times 6 minus 1, obviously, gives us the number, 35. And then we can insert expressions wherever we'd like. So here I'm inserting that specific expression in the typecommand. And this is also an expression, like I just said. And its result is int.
