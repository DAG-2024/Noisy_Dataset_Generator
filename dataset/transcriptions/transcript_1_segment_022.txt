So let's rewrite it versus x squared minus x ln x squaredplus 1. And then minus 2 x cubed minus x squared over x squared plus 1dx. So I have to remember how to do long division. So I have x cubed minus x. Now, depending how you learn this, you will draw the long division in different ways. So you just do it your way, and I'll do it my way. So that's x, and then minus x cubed minus x,then minus x squared, minus x, and that's minus 1. So this means that x cubed minus x squared over x squared plus 1 equals x minus 1 plusminus x plus 1 over x squared plus 1.
