And that's where most of my errors happen. And that's where I get super frustrated when I program. and that's probably where you guys will get super frustrated too. Because you write a program that you think is doing one thing,but instead either it crashes, right away,or it runs forever and doesn't really stop,or it terminates, but it gives you an incorrect answer. It's not what you were expecting. And we'll talk about this in a few lectures. So when we write programs, we're basically writing sequencesof definitions and commands. And we're going to write these either in a file editoror in a shell. The first today, at least, we're writing in the shelldirectly and half of tomorrow we'll write in the shellbecause we're not really writing many lines of code. We're just going to be showing you some really quick thingsthat we can do with the Python programming language. So hopefully you all have installed the programming environment. This is the code editor. So tomorrow we'll start working in here. But for today, we're really just going to work in the shell. And even in the future, you can still type commands in the shell.
