But how would you solve it? Right. So you do it. So for example, I can say that this is g prime and this is f. And then I integrate, I get cos, and then I do it again,and I will end up with some expression minus this integral,and then I solve for it. So you do this, and you get the answer to be somethinglike 1 half e to the x sine x minus cos xthen plus constant. So another type of examples, which are more difficult,are the ones which you cannot solve in just one go,but you have to find the recursive formula. So I'll just do an example like that. You've seen other examples before.
