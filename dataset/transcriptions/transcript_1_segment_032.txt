And now with this, you can get any integral you want. For example, if you want to get, I don't know, i6. You just follow that and you get that it's 1 6th cos to the 5th sin x plus 5 over 6 timesI4, which is 1 over 6 cos sin x plus 5 over 6 times I4 is 1 fourth cos cubed x sin xplus 3 4th I 2. Then what's I 2? I 2 is 1 half cos x sine x plus 1 half I 0 I 0 is x.
