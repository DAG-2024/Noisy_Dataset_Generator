Okay, welcome to introductory calculus. I will start with some practical information. Then I'll tell you a little bit about the syllabus and what we will cover in this course. And then give you some examples of differential equationsfrom physical sciences and then a little bit of integrationtowards the end. So for many of you, this might be the easiest coursethat you'll take in Oxford. But I think things will get progressively harder. So maybe in a couple of weeks, itwill be interesting to everybody if today's lecturemight be a bit too easy for some of you. So let me tell you some practical information. So we have 16 lectures.
