That's not exactly what I like to do. So 2x sine x and then minus cos x, then plus c. Is this? So plus plus. Thank you. Good. As I said. So see here, it denotes a constant,because we're doing indefinite integrals. All right. Let's do another example. So, again an indefinite integral 2x minus 1 times ln x squared plus 1 dx.
