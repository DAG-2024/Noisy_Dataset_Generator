All right, so welcome to the first lecture of 600L. That's our new number. My nameis Anna Bell. That's two separate names. First name, Hannah, last name, Bell, super confusing. I've been a lecturer here in the CS department for probably almost 10 years now and I've beendoing the intro course for a while. I'm really happy to be teaching this full semester version of 6100A. So today what we're going to do is go over a little bit of course administrative informationand then we'll dive right in to just some thoughts about computers, high level how theywork and then we'll start going into some Python basics. So we're going to get coding right away. So I highly encourage you, since you're in this class,to download the lecture slides beforehand,to take notes and run code when I do. Some of the lectures are interactive,so and we'll have breaks. So there'll be a place where you can take a breakto actually do some coding.
