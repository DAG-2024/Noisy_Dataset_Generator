Okay, questions so far before we move on. Yes? So why is division of Y is always result of? I can get like 9 by 3 and that's why it is a mysterious thing. Yeah, so the question is why does it always result in a float? If it didn't, I think the operation itself would have to do extra work to figure out whether it's a whole number or not. So I think it's just easier that it gives us always a float. I guess, previous versions of Python, the slash was actually, I think, integer division,which is super counterintuitive because you would use that in your programand then you would basically intitur divide and things would go wrong. But again, just a design choice on behalf of the programmers, yeah. Other questions so far. Okay. So we have a lot of objects, right? Objects have different types. Again, floats, integers, Booleans. What can we do with them? So far, they're kind of just sitting in thereand we can get properties about them. But what we'd like to do is write programs,basically trying to automate some thingsabout these objects, manipulate themto help us achieve a more complicated and interesting program.
