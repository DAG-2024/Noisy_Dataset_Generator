So we type this in the shell, and the shell tells uswhat the output is. So just to reiterate, int float, bool, and nuntip are types of objects. And there can be many different objects you can create of that type. So if you think about it, ints and floats, we basically have an infinite number of objectswe can create of those types. Right? Because we can have 0, 1, 2, 300, 200, 300 a million. Right? There's all the negatives. almost an infinite number of values,objects that we can create of the type inter-float. But bool, there's only two. The truth values, true or false. And the non-type, there's only one. This is not. So that's the type. And these are the possible values, possible objectswe can create. You try it. So you can just yell out the answers. There's nothing to type unless you want to check yourself. So what is the type of 1234? Int. Type of 8.99. Flute. Type of 9.0. Flute. Type of true. Bull. And type of false.
