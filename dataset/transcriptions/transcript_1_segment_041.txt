But I can rewrite the answer in a nicer form by dropping the absolute value andrequiring and dropping the assumption on C. So another way of doing this isWell, for uniformity, I will write it as 1 minus y squared equals c. So 1 minus y squared times 1 minus x squared equals c. No assumption on c except, so c could be both positive or negative,except in this formula, it looks like it can't be 0. Here I got an exponential, which is never 0. So this is positive. I dropped the absolute value, and the cost is that nowc can also be negative. But somehow 0 is missing. How is that possible?
