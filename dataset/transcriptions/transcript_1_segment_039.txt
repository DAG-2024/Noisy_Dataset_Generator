So now we could do a substitution as we did before,but I think we know how to do it. This looks like the derivative of a logarithm. So if I differentiate ln of x squared minus 1,then I get 2x over x squared minus 1. So except x is between 0 and 1. So maybe it's better to write this as 1x over 1 minus x squared. Get rid of the minus sign. So then I'll do 1 minus x squared minus 2x over 1 minus xsquared. So then this is minus ln of 1 minus x squared, andthe half, then plus the c. Whereas here, I'll have to putabsolute values, because I don't know. It's 1 half ln, soy squared minus 1 in absolute value.
