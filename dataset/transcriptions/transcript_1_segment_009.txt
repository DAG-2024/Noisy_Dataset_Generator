Y equals, so Y you can think of Y as being the anti-derivative of F of X, and then we canuse integrations. That's the simplest kind of differential equation that we can have. And this is the reason why we'll start the course by reviewing a little bit of integrationtechniques. But more interesting, there could be more interesting differential equations. So let me give you some examples from physical sciences. So for example, from mechanics, this is something that you have all seen. you can have Newton's second law, which says that the forceis the mass times the acceleration. So A is the acceleration. But then the acceleration is a derivative.
