So then the bottom line is that the answer is this implicitis it equation in y and x, where c can be any constant? So be careful when you divide by the function in y. As I said here, you can do that if you know that's not zero. But sometimes you get solutions from it being zero. So you have to be careful there. All right, that's the end of the first lecture. I'll see you tomorrow for the second lectureand we'll do more differential equations.
