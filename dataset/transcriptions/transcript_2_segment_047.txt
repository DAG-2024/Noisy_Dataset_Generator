We saw that we can create programs by manipulating objects. We created objects in Python, and wesaw that objects have a particular type. The type that the object has tells Python the thingsthat you can do with that object. We can combine objects in expressions,and these expressions evaluate or boil downto one particular value. Objects or values can be stored in variables. And these variables allow us to access these valueswith nicer names later on in our program. And then we're able to write needermore legible programs as well. So the equal sign, I showed you a couple of differencesbetween math and computer science. The equal sign was one notable difference, right? The equal sign in math is declarativeand the equal sign in computer science is an assignment. You're basically saying this is associated with this, right? And we're not doing any sort of equality in computer science. And yes, computers do what you tell them to do. That's kind of the big thing here, right? Line by line, it executes. Starting from the top goes line by line. So far, we haven't seen any places where the computer makes a decision.
