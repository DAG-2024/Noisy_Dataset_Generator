So y, this would be the dependent variable. And the derivatives of y with respect to x. So for example, dy dx, d squared y dx squared, et cetera. So the order of the highest derivative that occurs,We call that the order of the differential equation. So for example, the simplest of ODEwould be something of the form dy dx equals some functionx. So, dy dx equals f of x, you can solve that by direct integration. So, this can besolved.
