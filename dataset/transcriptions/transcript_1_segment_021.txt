So do you think which one should be f and which one should be g or g prime? Say that again. Right. So this, I want to differentiate to get rid of the logarithm. So I should call this f, which means that this is going to be g prime. Thank you. And that makes g x squared minus x. So this becomes x squared minus x times ln x squared plus1 minus the integral of x squared minus x times the derivative of the natural log of x squaredwhich is 2x over x squared plus 1 dx. So, I'm finally this term. What do I do here? Good. So, we do a long division.
