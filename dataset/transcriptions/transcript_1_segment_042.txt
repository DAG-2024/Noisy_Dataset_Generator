That doesn't look like solid mathematics. Yes? That's right. Okay. So where did I lose that case? Right here. So I divided by y squaredminus 1, I did that ignoring the case when y squared minus 1is 0. So let's call this star here. So in star, y minus 1 is not 0. But if we need to allow that, because it is possiblefor y to be plus or minus 1, for example. If y is the constant function 1, then this is 0, dy dx is 0. So that's OK. So if we allow, if y is plus minus 1 is included in thesolution if we allow C to be 0 in the answer.
