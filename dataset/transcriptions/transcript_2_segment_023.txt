So let's have you try this. What are the types of the following? I don't need the values, but the types. So if I get type of float of 123, what is the type of that? Float, yeah, exactly. Yep, I'm, yep. What if I round 7.9? What's the type of the result? Int, yep. What if I create a float of the round of 7.2? Yes, good. Float would be 7.0. And the int of 7.2? Int, yes, exactly. I want the type, not the value. And the int of 7.9 is an int, exactly. Awesome. Good. OK, so we've created a bunch of objects. We know that we can create a bunch of objects in our programs. What do we do with them? Well, we can combine them into expressions. So let's say we have 3 plus 2. I've got object, operator object. Cool, syntactically valid in Python,and has no static semantic error. So if I do that in Python, it's going to be OK, 3 plus 2, 5.
