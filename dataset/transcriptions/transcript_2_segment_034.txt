It's not equality, it's not a solve for x type of situation. It's just an assignment. It binds this name to this value. So the way that we figure out the name with the value is,well, if we have this assignment statement here,we first look at the right-hand side. We always start with the right hand side and we evaluate it. Remember, we have an expression on the right. We have to evaluate it to one value. So this will be 3.14, whatever it is, 1.159. And then we take that value and bind it to the name pi. So anytime I type in pi and my program from now on,Python will automatically grab 3.14159 from memory. So it's bound to that value now. OK, there are some rules that I have them on the previous one. Yes, there are some rules to variable names,but we'll talk about that in a bit. For now, I want you to tell me if any of the following are allowed. If I do x is equal to 6, is that allowed in Python? Yes, it is. Good, because I have one variable name, bound to one value 6. What about 6 equals x? It's just backward. OK, good. 6 equals x is bad, syntax error.
