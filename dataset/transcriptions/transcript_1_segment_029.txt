Now I need to differentiate f. So n minus 1 cos n minus 2 x. And then minus sine x. And then another sine x dx, which equals cos n minus 1x sine x minus n minus 1 times, or maybe I'll make it a plus,cos n minus 2x sine squared x dx. So if I write it like that, what do you do now? You write sine squared as 1 minus cos squared x,which then gives you cos n minus 1 x sin x plus n minus 1, the integral of cos n minus 2 x dx,minus n minus 1, the integral of cos n squared x dx.
