The percent gives me the remainder. So 5% 3 gives me the remainder when I divide 5 by 3. So it's going to give it to me in a whole number. So that's going to be 2, because there's 2 left overwhen I divide 5 by 3. So these are pretty useful operations,the slash slash and the percent whenwe do mathematical programs. The last thing is the star star is how we denote powerexponentiation, kind of different than you might be used to in math. So 2 to the power of 3, 8, right? 2 to the power of 3.0, 8.0. And the rules for integer division, percent, andexponentiation are just like addition subtraction multiplication. If one is a float, then the result will be a float as well. Okay, and we talked about the type of output. So I think I briefly mentioned this. The operator precedence is exponentiation and then multiplication division percent,remainder at the next level and then addition subtraction at the bottom,but you can always override these using parentheses.
