Bull. Perfect. If you ever wonder what the type of something is,you type it in here. Just you guys are doing well. Type is bull. Type of lowercase t true is an error. Just wanted to point that out. just to reiterate the fact that capitalization mattersin Python. This is our first error by the way, guys. Very exciting. The error is a name error, and this is the messageassociated with it. You also know that it's something special in Pythonwhen you have color-coded stuff. So you see capital T true, capital F falseare this dark blue here, whereas anything that's notSpesial and Python is just black. So type is a special command. This is a float. So you see their color coded. OK. So once we create objects, one thing wecan do with these objects is to cast them to a different type. Now, this is a little bit maybe confusing,because we're not actually changing the object once we've created it. So once we create the integer 3, it'sthere in memory. If we cast that integer to a float version of it,we're creating a new object in memory.
