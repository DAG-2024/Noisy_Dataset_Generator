I'm basically saying what the code is doing. Please don't do that. We can see that a equals p times r times r. I see that I'm multiplying p with r squared. I don't need to read that in English. What I would like to see is a comment like this. Here I'm commenting a chunk of code. And someone who doesn't want to read this chunk of codejust reads the comment. And I already know that I'm calculating the area in circumferenceusing an approximation for pi. That's a pretty nice comment there. And good descriptive names and all that. So we can actually, once we create an object, a variable,sorry, once we create an object and bind it to a variable,we can change the bindings. So we can take that variable name and bind itto a completely different value. This might not be sort of useful right now,but it will be useful when we introduce control flowin our programs. So to re-bind a variable, what that meansis we're going to take the name. We're going to lose the binding to the previous valueand we're going to rebind it to a new value. So I'm going to show you how this looks like in memory.
