It represents all the real numbers. So 3.27, 2.0 is a float because it has a decimal number,even though to us that just means 2. But to Python, if you put in 2.0, it says that's a type float. Negative 3.14159, things like that. Bull is a Boolean. It represents truth values. And there's only two possible values that a Boolean type has. True and false. And it has to be capital F false. And the last one is this none type. Type, it's literally called none type. And it has only one special value, none. We're not going to talk about it for a bit,but we will sometime in the future. So to figure out the type of an object,when you create that object, you use the type command. So we can say something like type, parentheses. And this is a command. And inside the parentheses, you say, whatdo you want to find the type of? So if we do type of seven, ittells me it's an int. And if you want to do the same command again,I hit the up arrow and it automaticallyputs in what I wrote previously. And then if I want to do type of 0.0,it's a float, because there's a decimal point. So this is basically what I said.
