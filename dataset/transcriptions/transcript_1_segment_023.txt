Did you get the same thing? So let's call this integral j. And now we compute j, the integral of x minus 1plus minus x plus 1 over x squared plus 1. the x, which equals x squared minus x. And then how do I integrate this term, the fraction? So I should split x over x squared plus 1, the x. Yeah? And let me write the last term plus dx over x squared plus 1. So this one, the last term, we should recognize that what is it?
