Yeah, now I can safely resign x to temp. So I can say x is equal to temp because temp points to 2. And I want to make x point to 2 as well. So in terms of code, so that's sort of the diagram,but we can write the code. So you don't, let's see. We don't write it in here, but on your own,you can write it in here if you'd like,or we can do it together. So x equals 1, y equals 2. And then we had temp. We wanted to assign it to whatever y was. So we say temp is equal to y. And if you want to check the values of the variables,you can just invoke the names. So x is 1, y is 2, and temp shouldbe whatever y is, 2. OK, good so far. So now I'm at the step here, I think. I've just created this. And then the last thing I need to dois lose the binding from x to whatever temp is. So I want to do this operation here, which means Iwant to assign x to be equal to temp.
