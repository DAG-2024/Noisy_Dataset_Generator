And a variable is different in computer sciencefrom a mathematical variable, or variablesthat you've known so far in math. So math variables come back to the ideaof declarative knowledge, a declarative statement. You can have something like A plus B is equal to B minus 1in math, or x times x is equal to y. And that's perfectly OK. In math, we basically say that variable xrepresents all the square roots of y. That's not going to fly in computer science. Computer science, we don't do declarative knowledge. We do imperative knowledge. And so what we're working with in computer scienceis a bunch of assignment statements. So what we can do in computer scienceis we're going to basically bind a value to a variable. So we're going to say this variable nameis bound to this value. Every time I want to grab this value,I'm going to invoke this variable name. So here are some examples. I've got a is equal to b plus 1. The thing on the right-hand side will evaluate to some valueas long as I have something that B, you know, B as a value for. I've got here m is equal to 10, right? So m is a variable.
