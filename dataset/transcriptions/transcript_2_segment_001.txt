And that's important. I call them you try breaks. That's important to make sure that you're actuallypracticing what we are learning right at this time. The main idea for lectures is yes, I will do some teaching,but there will also be opportunities for questionsand for you guys to try some programming right on the spot. Even if you don't finish writing a programthat we start talking about, I will finish itand we can all kind of talk about it togetherand I'll kind of show you some pitfallsand things like that. There will be lots of opportunities to practicein this class through at various degrees of granularityand then there's also lots of opportunitiesthat I have in the handouts to do extra practice at homeand through a bunch of different resources as well. The reason why I stress participation and practiceis because part of the reason you're hereis you want to learn how to program, right? You don't know how to program yet. And programming is actually a skill, right? It's like math or reading. It's something that you have to practice. You can't just watch me type in a bunch of lines of codeand then when it comes time for to do the quiz,you automatically know how to do it. You need to do it often more and moreso that it becomes sort of second nature, right? So the three big things you'll get out of this classare knowledge of concepts.
