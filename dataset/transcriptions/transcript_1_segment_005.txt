So this should be viewed as a gentle introduction into multi-variable calculus. So among the things that we'll do, we'll look at various surfaces, gradients,normal vectors, we'll look at Taylor's theorem into variables, critical points,And a little bit of Lagrange multipliers,which are useful for optimization problems. Now, there is a lot of interaction between this course and otherpre-limb courses that you will take. So, intercalculus will be directly useful, obviously,multivariable calculus, as I said. In a way, it's a little bit unfair.
