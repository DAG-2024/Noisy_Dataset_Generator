Obviously, we're gonna learn some computer science ideas,programming skill and problem solving skills. Lectures and exams basically help youtheir knowledge of, test your knowledge of conceptsand help you get knowledge of concepts. Finger exercises give you the programming skillsand the problem sets help you with problem solving. Basically, if you're given an English versionof a problem in English, how do yougo from that to thinking about what computer science conceptscan I apply? And then after that, how do I take those computer scienceconcepts and actually do the programming? So what are some topics we'll be covering? We will be at the core of it learning computational thinking. So in the future, when you encounter a problem,your first thought shouldn't be, how do I mathematicallysolve this or how do I brute force manually solve this problem. How can I apply computation to help me solve this problem? And throughout these lectures, you'regoing to see some examples of us applying computationto a problem you might have already seenand maybe solved mathematically, which is pretty cool. Obviously, to get to that, we're going to learn a Python programming language.
