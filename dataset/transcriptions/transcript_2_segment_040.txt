And then bind it to the left hand side. So if we look at the right hand side first, right,we see radius, well, what's the value, 2.2? We see add 1 to it, 3.2, save that in memory,and then we see the assignment. Now save it with the name radius. So we can only have one variable assigned to one valueat a time. This is not math, this is computer science. So you can only have radius 0.21 thing at a time. With this line of code, radius equals radius plus 1,we've lost the binding to 2.2, this object in memory,and we've rebounded to the value 3.2. And that's perfectly fine. 2.2 is now just sitting in memory. We can't get back to it unless we say maybe radius equals 2.2. It just sits in memory and then may I be collected later onor reclaimed by garbage collection or something like that. But for now, we can't get back to it. Now, what's the value for area at the end of these lines? Well, according to this, it's 15.1976. So it's using the old 2.2 value for radius.
