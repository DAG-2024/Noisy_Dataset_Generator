All right. So that's any questions about this. OK, now syllabus. So the first half of the course about seven or eight lectureswill be devoted to differential equations. So this is about seven or eight lectures. So of two kinds, ordinary differential equations,or these, and partial differential equations, or PDs. So I'll give you some examples very soon. We'll look at fairly easy examples of differential equations.
