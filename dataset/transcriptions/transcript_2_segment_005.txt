How do we go from there? So the steps we follow, step 1, if 3 times 3, 9 is close enough to 16, we can stop. It's not really close enough for me. So let's keep going. Step two. Otherwise, so we're going to make a new guess by averaging g,which is our original guess three, and x over g, whichis 16 over 3, right? 16 was the square we wanted to find. So our next guess is 4.17. OK. Using the new guess, repeat the processuntil we are close enough. So we go back to step one. That's the first part of the process. We find guess squared, 4.17 squared is 17.36. So now we say is that close enough? Not really, it's not, it's 17. It's not really even close 16. So let's do it again. We make a new guess by averaging 4.17 and 16 dividedby 4.17. That gives us our new guess, 4.3035. Next step, using the new guess, we repeat the process. So 4.3035 squared is 16.277. 0.0277. Is that close enough to x? Yeah, I could be happy with this.
