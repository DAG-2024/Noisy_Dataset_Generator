And the type of 3 plus 2 is an integer. So basically, what I've done here,I've put an expression within this type command. And that's OK. That's, in fact, encouraged in Python. You don't just want to calculate and then stick in. That would be very, very tedious. So you can insert expressions in many, many different places. So here we have 3 plus 2, 5 divided by 3. Again, we've got 5 divided by 3 has this decimal value. And the result is of type float. So the important thing to remember when we're doing expressionsis Python reads the expression, but it does not store the expression in memory. Okay? What it does is it reads the expression, evaluates it to one single value,and then it stores the result value in memory. So it never stores the expression, it evaluates the expression, and then stores the value. Okay? And so this is the syntax for an expression, object, operator object, as we just saw. And that's really, and the idea I said before, right,where Python stores values of expressions,not the expressions themselves, is really, really important.
