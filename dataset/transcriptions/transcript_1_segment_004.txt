We'll learn some techniques. It's a combination, solving them. It's a combination of science and art. You have to do some educated guesses at some points. But it's quite an interesting and very useful subject. And then after that, we'll talk about line and doubleintegrals, line integrals and double integrals. And the reason these are useful is because wewill be able to compute arc lengths of curves and areasof various regions in the plane or surfaces. So this is maybe three lectures. And then finally, we'll do calculus of functions in two variables.
