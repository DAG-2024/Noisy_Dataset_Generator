I could stop there because we're within plus minus 1. So I'm OK with that. But if we wanted to be within plus or minus 1,times 10 to the negative like 6 or 7 or something like that,then we would continue the process. So really what we had there is an algorithm. It's a sequence of steps. Step one, step two, step three. There's some sort of flow of control. We had a place where we said if the guess is close enough,then we can stop. Otherwise, we do something else. We had another flow of control where we said repeat this thing. So we're not going linearly, but we're changing the flow. And then lastly, is a way to stop. We don't want the algorithm to go on forever. We would like to stop at some point. And the stopping point, I was kind of vague about it. But it could be when we were within plus or minus oneof the actual answer. And so recipes are basically algorithms. My grandmother was basically teaching algorithmswhen she would teach me to bake a cake. She didn't call it that, but she was, really. And so even recipes have that same structure. There's a sequence of steps. There's a flow of control.
