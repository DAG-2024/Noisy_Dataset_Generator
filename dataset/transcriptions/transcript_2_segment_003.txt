Once we get the basics, we're going to see how we can structure our code to look a littlebit better so we don't just have a bunch of code dumped in a file. We're going to start to organize our code and see how we can make a neat readableand modular. And then towards the, not in this lecture, but in a couple lectures and as a themethroughout this class, we're going to look at some algorithms. They're not super complicated, but they'rekind of the base algorithms for a bunch of algorithmsyou might see in the future if you decideto take more CS classes. Lastly, towards the end of the class,we're going to see algorithmic complexity, which basicallymeans we're going to start asking or tryingto answer the question, how do we know the programs we writeare efficient? We can write programs, but how do we know that they're fast? and how do we know that they don't take up all the memoryin the computer. So things like that, comparing different algorithmsthat do the same thing against each other. So if there's no questions, again, as I said,a bunch of this information is already in the handout,plus more, we can begin. OK, so let's start by talking about knowledge.
