And similarly, we can also insert that expression here,and then we can wrap that around cast. And it gives us a flow. Yes. So when you're inserting what? Oh, since you said there are expressions,then you said that you need object operatorthe object expression, the type of flowto be the operator to use case. Oh, I see. So that's how they define it. Yeah, that's a good question. So in this particular case, the type and the floatare not, there is no operator, I guess,in this particular case. It's more like a command that gives us an output. But there is still an output that isSo we can then take the result of this and save it somewhere else. Sorry, yeah. I guess the example I gave on the previous slide was just an example of an expression where we could do object operator object. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So when we have these, I guess it works for mathematical expressions.
