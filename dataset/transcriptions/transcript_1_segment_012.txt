But then I'm interested, for example, in the currentacross the circuit. So this is the current across I of t is the current acrossthe circuit, which is a function of the time. So in terms of differential equations, t the timewould be the independent variable. And this i of t, for example, is a dependent variable. I can also have q of t, which is the charge across the capacitor,sorry, on the capacitor. And the relation between the two of themis that i is dq dt. So Kirchhoff's law says that the total voltage is zeroaround the circuit, which is in another way the voltage Vfrom the battery, which is a function of T, equals the voltageacross the resistor plus the voltage across the inductorplus the voltage on the capacitor.
