So, so far we've been able to find really nice parallelswith English, right? The English language and the programming languages,but this is kind of where things break down. When we talk about the semantics of a language. So, in English, you can have many different meanings, right? The chicken is ready to eat means, let's eat this chicken,or the chicken is ready to eat means the chicken wantsto eat something, right? Programming languages, there is no multiple meaningsto a program that you write. Because the computer, the machine, the language,follows the set of instructions to a T,there is no ambiguity about what it needs to do. It just follows the instructionsand does what it needs to do to the end,till it terminates the program. And so programs only have one meaning,but the problem is it might not be the meaningthat you intended it to have. And that's when things start to go wrong. We can have syntactic errors in our program,spelling errors, and indentation errors, things like that. And those are easy to catch. Static semantic errors are 90% probably easy to catch. But the problem comes in with the semantics, right? The meaning that you intended this program to havemight not be what it's actually doing.
