Super tedious. All we did was add 3 plus 4. We do that again. We add the values at 7889 and 7890. So it goes in the memory, it grabs the 5 and the 2,sends it to the ALU. The ALU calculates as 7, brings it back,and then we store that in location 7891. And then after that, all we've done is two additions. And then the next instruction says,compare the values at memory locations 3, 4, 5, 8, and 7891. So we're going to compare the 7 with the 7. The ALU again does this comparison and says, all right,well, 7 and 7 are equivalent. So this is true or whatever it wants to give backto the interpreter. And then the last instruction here,we have is print the result of that comparison. So we print true because they were equal. Again, super high level, but it kind of gives youan appreciation for programming languages these days. This is very tedious to write if we had to write programsin this manner. Allentering a long time ago showed that you can computeanything with actually a very, even more basic set ofprimitives, not addition subtraction. But instead, with a tape, you would actually have sixprimitives.
