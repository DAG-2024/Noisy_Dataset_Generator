How about x times y equals 3 plus 4? Nope, exactly, because the thing on the left has an operatorin it, and operators are special. So you can't have a variable with that star as a name. How about xy equals 3 plus 4? Allowed, yes, exactly. I was hoping to get you guys with that. But I didn't. xy equals 3 plus 4 is OK. There was no error. And then I can invoke the name of the variable I just createdsimply by typing it in. So if I type in xy, it gives me 7. And then I can do operations with it, xy plus 1 is 8. Yeah. Before you were bringing this thing to the top of your screen,so when do you use it? So those are strings, sequences of characters. These are variables. So these are names that I am giving as a variable. That's a great question. So this is going to be a string, and you notice it changed color. It has some meaning in Python. But x, y is a variable that I create. OK. So why do we want to give names to variables? Because as I showed you with the pi example,it's a lot easier to write readable codeif you have variable names within your programs.
