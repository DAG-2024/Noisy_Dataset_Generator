And now you write each one of them. The voltage across the resistor by Ohm's lawis R times I of t. The one on the capacitor is just 1 over c times the charge. And for the inductor is L, the constant times di dt,which is Faraday's law. So now, I can express, for example,so I have an equation involving v, i and q. But i is dq dt, so I can rewrite everythingin terms of q, for example. So I can get differential equation in q, whichwill be simply, so this would be the leading term, dI dt.
