So L times dI dt becomes L times d squared q dt squared,plus R i is R times dq dt plus 1 over c times q equals v. So that is a second order differential equationthat appears in electrical circuits. So it's second order because the highest derivative is of second order. It has constant coefficients because the constants all L, R, and C are constant. And it's what we'll call in homogeneous because this doesn't have to be zero. So those are the type of differential equations that we can study. And there are many other examples. So I'll leave one as an exercise for you,an easy exercise.
