Okay, so now let's put them all together. So J is 1 half x squared minus x minus 1 halfL n x squared plus 1 plus 10 inverse of x and some constant,which means that the original integral in the beginning,which I should have called i, so that I don't have to rolldown the board, but equals x squared minus x l n x squared plus 1 minus twice this. So minus x squared plus 2x plus ln x squared plus 1 minus 10inverse x and then plus c.
