So this is when we get a reduction,or if you want to call it a recursive formula. So, I start, suppose I'm looking at this integral cosine to the n x dx. Now, I want to labelthis integral i n because I'm going to get a formula of i n in terms of i n minus 1 ori n minus 2, et cetera. Now, there is not much choice here what you should call f and what you should call g. So I'm going to just do it. So this is cos n minus 1 x times cos x dx. So this is f, and this is g prime. Then we get cos n minus 1 x sine x minus d integral.
