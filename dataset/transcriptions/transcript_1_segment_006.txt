We set up the work. We do some examples in introduction calculus. But then the really cool results and theoremsyou prove in multi-variable calculus. So we just do a little bit of the groundwork towards that. You also do, these are also useful in dynamics and PDEs. You will do next term for yes series and PDEs. Now, there is a lot of interactionbetween intercalculus and analysis, particularlyanalysis 2, which is what you do next term. So there will be quite a few results from analysis thatwill just state and not prove, maybeprove some particular examples and so on. But real rigorous proofs you'll do in analysis next term. But then it all comes together when you revise for yourexams in Trinity. So as that first in part A, there will be lots of appliedmathematics options that will continue.
