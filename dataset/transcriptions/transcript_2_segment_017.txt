And the type that an object has tells Python the things you're allowed to do with thatobject. So here are two examples. The number 30, it's a number. The type, we'll talk about it in a bit. The type is an integer. It's a whole number. But basically, what are the things we can do with this integer? With this number? We can add it to another number. We can subtract it to another number. We can take it to another power. We can take some other number to this power of 30, right? A bunch of mathematical operations, as you would expect. So that's pretty straightforward. What about this one here? This quotation, capital A, lowercase and lowercase A, quotation. So this is something we'll talk about next lecture. It's called a string. And it's a sequence of characters. The quotations tell Python. It's a sequence of characters. And the characters, part of it, are capital A, lowercase,and lowercase A. The kinds of thingsI can do with this string are not the same kinds of thingsI'm allowed to do with a number. If I tried to take Anna and divide itby the sequence of characters, Bob, Pythonwould complain very much. Because you can't divide a string by another string. A sequence of characters doesn't make senseto divide it by another sequence of characters.
