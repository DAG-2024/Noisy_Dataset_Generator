And that's OK, because the program never had a line thatsaid recalculate area after we changed the radius. It's just following, done, line by line. It doesn't know that, hey, if I change the radius,the user might want the area changed. It doesn't make those connections. It's just following instructions. And that's OK. If we wanted to change the area, we would have to copy this lineand paste it after we've changed the radius. And then the area would change as well. Does that make sense? That's kind of an important part of this lecture. OK, cool. So big idea here is our lines are evaluated one after the other. We're not skipping. We're not repeating things. That's something we're going to learn about later. But for now, line by line. So here's a little U-try it. These three lines are executed in order. What are the values for meters and feet variables at each line? So how about at the first line? What's the value for meters after we execute the first line? 100. What about feet? So at the end of the first line, there is no value for feet yet.
