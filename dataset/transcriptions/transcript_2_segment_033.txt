Its value is 10. I've got f is equal to m times 9.98. So again, I have an expression on the right-hand side,and that's OK. I'm going to use the value of 10. So f's value will be 99.8. Yeah. So if you put it so that like for f,is it like this one volume, or can you have it? So it's going to be whatever ms and recent mean for like,yeah, the question is, can you have m whatever it recently is? So in this particular case, I just have these two lines,and m will be whatever 10 is. But we'll see in a couple lecturesthat we can write like a loop where you change m,and then every time you change m, youand then it will calculate f based on the new value of m. But if we just have these two lines, that's all there is. It just uses 10. Was there another question? Okay. So in computer science, you have only one variable to the left of thisequal sign called the assignment operator. And you have a value to the right hand side of the equal sign,the assignment operator. So one variable basically maps to or binds to one value. So the equal sign is an assignment statement.
