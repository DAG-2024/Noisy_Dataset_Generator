So I'll tell you the problem is the rate at whicha radioactive substance, dk's, is proportional to the remaining number of atoms. terms. So I want you to, as an exercise,to write a differential equation thatdescribes this situation. So we'll come back to things like this later. So the question is, what's the differential equation? Okay. So as you progress along in this course, in the mathematics course here, you willencounter very, very interesting and sophisticated differential equations in applied mathematics.
