So the computer basically has memory where things are stored. It has an arithmetic logic unit that does operations. It knows how to add things, subtract things, multiply things, compare things. And then it has the control unit where this program counter is set. And this is where you put a program in. So this works. This is a program. And up here is our memory. So we have a bunch of memory locations, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 7. that each of these memory locations,we have some values stored, you know, pre-filled. So when we first run this program,what ends up happening is the interpretersees the first instruction add,the values at 3, 4, 5, 6 and 3, 4, 5, 7 together. So it goes to these memory locations here,grabs the 3 and the 4,and sends them to the arithmetic logic unit. The ALU knows how to do the addition. So it adds 3 plus 4, 7,and sends the result back here. Now, we never told it to store that result anywhere,but the next instruction says, store the value you justgot back from the ALU at this memory location 3458. So the next step basically takes that 7and stores it at memory location 3458.
