How about after the second line? 328.8, right? How about the value for meters? 100 still. And what about after the third line? I'm changing meters to 200. Exactly, yeah, meters is 200, but feet is still 328.08. And this is something I want to show you guys today. And we're going to use this Python tutor a lot morein the future. Python tutor is a nice website that allows youto step in your code, step through your code, step by step. So at each line that you execute,you get to see the values of all the variables in the code. It's very useful debugging tool. I hope you'll try it out today and on Monday, maybefor the finger exercises if you're having trouble. And you can use it for quizzes to help you debug. But I can just show you. It's pretty simple here because it's just a step-by-step. So we step through. So the red says the line I'm going to execute. Green is the line I just executed. So I just executed meters of hundreds. So here I have my meters variable with the value 100. Step through next. So I just executed feed equals this. So I now have a variable named feetwith a value 328.08 meters still 100.
