if you don't have a user substitute or repeat this,repeat sticking a toothpick to see if it comes out cleanevery minute or something like that. And then there's a way to stop, right? When the toothpick comes out clean,you take it out of the oven and you eat it. And so computers are machines that execute these algorithms. They're actually dumb, right? Computers are not very smart. They don't make decisions on their own. They just follow these sequences of stepsthat we told them to do. Computers are good at storing lots and lots of data. We can't really do that, but computerscan store gigabytes of storage, terabytes even. And computers can do operations really, really quickly,which is something we can't do. They're good at those two things, but they're not very smart. They can't make decisions unless they'retold to make the decisions. So really, the computer only does what you tell it to do. And that's one of the big ideas that I want you to come awayfrom this lecture with. Computer only does what you tell it to do. The sequences of steps that you tell it to do,that's the only thing it follows. So a little brief history, just to kind of makeyou appreciate programming Python programming languagebefore we actually get started with it, is,so before the 1940s, we had these things calledfixed program computers, OK?
